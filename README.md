## Don't ask to ask, just ask
In support chatrooms, questions like "Can I ask a question?" are considered to be poor etiquette. Support chatrooms exist purely for purpose of asking questions, and there is no need to ask permission to speak. These questions are bad because they waste time, making busy people less likely to offer their help even if they may know, and often place an obligation on the answerer to help the asker with whatever their real question is, even if the answerer may not know.

Similarly, questions like "Anyone here use X?" are also poor etiquette, as they are useless chatter and obligate whoever answers to help the asker, even if the question turns out to not even be related to 'X', or could be actually be answered by someone who doesn't use it. If that isn't the right chatroom to ask that question, you will likely be pointed to the correct chatroom after asking.

Just ask your question. Provide a description of your issue, be specific, and if someone is able to help, they will.

## What have you tried?
When explaining your problem, it is often helpful to mention what attempts you have made to solve the problem yourself. This may help others understand what you are stuck on, as well as your requirements for the solution.

## Give details
"It doesn't work" isn't enough information for someone to help with your issue. Be specific. Explain what you think should happen, and what is actually happening. Provide the error messages you see, if there are any.

## XY Problem
The XY problem is asking about your attempted solution rather than your actual problem. That is, you are trying to solve problem X, and you think solution Y would work, but instead of asking about X when you run into trouble, you ask about Y.

This often causes a lot of frustration as others are confused because Y seems like a strange problem to want to solve, only to later find out the asker really wants help with X. There's usually a much better solution for X, and sometimes Y isn't even a suitable solution. Remember, if your theories on how to solve X were correct, you most likely wouldn't be asking for help.

Take a step back and try to explain the actual problem you are trying to solve. If there are other solutions you've already ruled out, you should explain why, as it will give more information about your requirements.
